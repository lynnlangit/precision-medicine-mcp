---

## Instructions for Claude

You are creating SHORT, punchy text for an infographic that will use visual design elements (icons, charts, illustrations) to tell the story. Text should be minimal, memorable, and meaningful.

**Audience:** Cancer patient and their family (all ages, no scientific training)

**Reading Level:** 6th-8th grade (ages 11-14)

**Tone:** Clear, empowering, hopeful

**Length:** 5-10 bullet points, each 1-2 sentences maximum (10-25 words per point)

**Key Principles:**
1. Use active voice and strong verbs
2. Make every word count - no filler
3. Focus on the "so what?" not just the "what"
4. Use metaphors sparingly but effectively
5. Numbers should be simple and contextual
6. Each bullet should stand alone (patient may only read 1-2)

---

## Input Data

**Paste key molecular findings and spatial analysis results:**

```
{{KEY_FINDINGS}}
```

**Example format:**

## Output Format

Generate infographic text following this structure:

### YOUR TUMOR PROFILE: WHAT WE LEARNED

[Title section - 1 sentence, 15-20 words]
"Advanced molecular testing revealed why your tumor resists treatment and identified new options to try."

---

### KEY FINDINGS

[5-8 bullet points, each 10-25 words]

**Format each bullet as:**
- **[Bold lead-in phrase]:** [Plain language explanation with impact]

**Examples:**

- **Multiple tumor regions:** Your tumor has 6 different areas, each with unique characteristics that may respond differently to treatment.

- **Active resistance pathways:** Cancer cells are using backup survival routes (PI3K/AKT pathway) that help them escape chemotherapy.

- **Drug pump detected:** Tumor cells have high levels of ABCB1, a protein that pushes chemotherapy drugs out before they can work.

- **Hypoxic zones identified:** Low-oxygen areas in your tumor may resist standard treatment but could respond to specialized drugs.

- **Immune activity present:** Areas of immune cell infiltration suggest your immune system is fighting back and may respond to immunotherapy.

**Guidelines for bullets:**
- Start with impact word: "Active", "Detected", "Identified", "Found"
- Use present tense
- Avoid passive voice ("was found" → "detected")
- Include one actionable implication when possible
- Mix findings (what we saw) with meaning (what it means for treatment)

---

### WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOUR TREATMENT

[2-3 bullet points, each 15-25 words]

**Format:**
- **[Treatment category]:** [Plain language explanation of why this might work]

**Examples:**

- **PI3K inhibitors:** Drugs that block the backup survival pathway we found active in your tumor (clinical trials available).

- **Resistance reversal agents:** Medications that stop the drug pump (ABCB1) from pushing chemotherapy out of tumor cells.

- **Hypoxia-targeting drugs:** Specialized treatments designed to kill cancer cells in low-oxygen areas where standard drugs don't reach.

---

### NEXT STEPS

[2-3 action items, each 10-15 words]

**Examples:**

- Discuss PI3K inhibitor clinical trials with your oncologist at next visit
- Ask about combining resistance reversal drugs with current chemotherapy
- Review all options considering your treatment goals and quality of life

---

### [Optional: STATISTICS TO VISUALIZE]

[If infographic includes charts/graphs, provide 2-4 data points with context]

**Format:**
- [Number] → [Plain language context label]

**Examples:**

- 17 genes → Significantly different in tumor vs. normal tissue
- 6 regions → Distinct areas within your tumor, each unique
- 3× higher → Activity level of resistance pathway compared to normal
- 31 genes → Show spatial clustering (concentrated in specific tumor areas)

---

### [Optional: BOTTOM DISCLAIMER]

[Single sentence, 20-30 words, required for legal/ethical compliance]

"This analysis is for education and research. Your oncology team will determine the best treatment plan for your specific situation."

## Complete Example Output

### YOUR TUMOR PROFILE: WHAT WE LEARNED

"Molecular testing revealed why your tumor resists platinum chemotherapy and identified three new treatment pathways to discuss with your doctor."

---

### KEY FINDINGS

- **Multiple survival routes detected:** Your tumor uses the PI3K/AKT pathway as a backup system to survive even when chemotherapy blocks other growth signals.

- **Drug resistance pump active:** High ABCB1 levels mean tumor cells push chemotherapy out before it can work, explaining resistance to platinum drugs.

- **Six distinct tumor regions:** Different areas of your tumor have unique characteristics, including active growth zones, low-oxygen areas, and immune-infiltrated regions.

- **Hypoxic zones identified:** Low-oxygen areas resist standard chemotherapy but may respond to specialized drugs that target hypoxic cells.

- **Immune cells present:** Areas with high immune activity suggest your body is fighting back and may respond to immunotherapy approaches.

---

### WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOUR TREATMENT

- **PI3K/AKT inhibitors:** Block the backup survival pathway we found (drugs like Alpelisib are available in clinical trials).

- **Resistance reversal agents:** Stop the ABCB1 pump from ejecting chemotherapy, making your tumor more vulnerable to existing drugs.

- **Hypoxia-targeting drugs:** Specialized treatments designed to kill cancer cells in low-oxygen zones where regular chemo doesn't reach.

---

### NEXT STEPS

- Ask your oncologist about PI3K inhibitor clinical trials for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer
- Discuss combining resistance reversal drugs with your current bevacizumab (Avastin) therapy
- Review options considering your treatment goals, quality of life, and personal preferences

---

### BY THE NUMBERS

- **17 genes** significantly different between tumor and normal tissue
- **6 regions** within tumor, each with unique treatment vulnerabilities
- **3× higher** resistance pathway activity compared to healthy cells
- **31 genes** showing spatial patterns revealing tumor organization

## Visual Design Suggestions

[Optional: Add suggestions for how designers should treat this text]

### Layout Recommendations:

**Title:** Large, bold, top of page

**Key Findings:**
- Use icons for each bullet (e.g., 🔬 for molecular, 🎯 for targeting, 💊 for drugs)
- Stagger bullets or use circular layout
- Each bullet in separate visual block

**What This Means:**
- Use different color (e.g., blue for findings, green for treatments)
- Arrow or bridge graphic connecting "findings" to "treatment"
- Box or highlight to emphasize actionable items

**Next Steps:**
- Numbered list or checklist visual
- Calendar icon or "appointment prep" theme
- Separate tear-off section if printed

**Statistics:**
- Bar charts or circular progress indicators
- Large numbers with small context labels
- Visual comparison (normal vs. tumor)

## Example: Side-by-Side Comparison

### ❌ Too Technical (Original):
```
• TP53 mutation: log2FC = 4.654, FDR = 5.04e-20
• 31 genes with significant spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I > 0.1, p < 0.001)
• PIK3CA/AKT1/MTOR dysregulation suggests PI3K pathway dependency
```

### ✅ Patient-Friendly (Template Output):
```
• Multiple survival routes detected: Your tumor uses the PI3K/AKT pathway
  as a backup to survive even when chemotherapy blocks other growth signals.

• Six distinct tumor regions: Different areas have unique characteristics
  including active growth zones and low-oxygen regions.

• New treatment targets identified: PI3K inhibitor drugs may block the
  backup survival pathway we found active in your tumor.
