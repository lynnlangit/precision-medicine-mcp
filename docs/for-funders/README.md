## Why This Project Matters

**Dedicated to PatientOne** - a dear friend who passed from High-Grade Serous Ovarian Carcinoma in 2025.

**The Problem:**
- Stage IV ovarian cancer: **30% 5-year survival rate**
- Precision medicine analysis takes **40 hours** - too slow for urgent treatment decisions
- Manual analysis costs **$6,000-9,000 per patient**
- Most hospitals can't afford comprehensive multi-omics analysis

**This Solution:**
- **35 minutes** for complete analysis (genomics + spatial + imaging + clinical)
- **$324 per patient** (vs. $6,000 traditional)
- **Natural language interface** - no coding required for clinicians
- **HIPAA-compliant** - ready for hospital production
